# iOS HTML Viewer

> from vscode Aug 14, 2024 : 8:57 PM

iOS HTML Viewer is a simple yet powerful tool that addresses the frustrating limitations of viewing local HTML files on iOS devices. The default iOS file previewer always strips out critical elements like external CSS and JavaScript, leaving users with a bland, static representation of their content. This tool allows you to fully render and interact with your HTML files directly on your iPhone or iPad, just as you would on a desktop browser.

## Why It's Needed

iOS support for viewing local HTML files is dismal. The built-in file previewer on iOS always removes external stylesheets and JavaScript, leaving users with a plain, non-interactive version of their content. While some third-party apps exist, they often come with intrusive ads, charge monthly subscriptions, or fail to fully support external assets. These solutions can be cumbersome, expensive, and privacy-invasive, making them less than ideal for users who just need a quick, reliable way to view their HTML content.

iOS HTML Viewer solves this problem by rendering the complete HTML content, including external CSS and JavaScript, right within your browser. It’s a straightforward, ad-free, and privacy-focused solution that ensures your HTML files are fully interactive and displayed as intended—all without the need for subscriptions or ads.

### Bonus Feature: View HTML Source Code with Syntax Highlighting

In addition to rendering your HTML files, iOS HTML Viewer offers an optional feature to view the source code of the uploaded file with **color syntax highlighting**. This is particularly useful for developers who want to inspect, debug, or review the HTML content. You can easily toggle between the rendered view and the syntax-highlighted source code, all within the same tool.

## Key Features

- **Full HTML Rendering**: Supports external CSS and JavaScript, providing a desktop-like viewing experience on iOS.
- **View Source Code with Syntax Highlighting**: Optionally view the raw HTML source code of your uploaded file, complete with color syntax highlighting.
- **Ad-Free and Subscription-Free**: No ads or hidden costs—just a simple, effective solution for viewing HTML files.
- **Privacy First**: Your uploaded HTML files are processed locally on your device, ensuring complete privacy and security.
- **Cross-Platform**: While designed for iOS, this viewer also works on other platforms like Android and desktop browsers.
- **Standalone Mode**: Can be added to your home screen as a standalone app, though browser use is recommended due to refresh limitations in standalone mode.
