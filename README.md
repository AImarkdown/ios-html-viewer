# iOS HTML Viewer

iOS HTML Viewer is a simple yet powerful tool that addresses the frustrating limitations of viewing local HTML files on iOS devices. The default iOS file previewer often strips out critical elements like external CSS and JavaScript, leaving users with a bland, static representation of their content. This tool allows you to fully render and interact with your HTML files directly on your iPhone or iPad, as you would on a desktop browser.

## Why It's Needed
iOS support for viewing local HTML files is dismal. While some solutions exist—such as third-party apps or workarounds—they often come with limitations, clunky interfaces, or privacy concerns. Many of these apps either fail to fully support external assets (CSS and JavaScript), are paid solutions, or require complex setups that can be cumbersome to use.

iOS HTML Viewer solves this problem by rendering the complete HTML content, including external CSS and JavaScript, right within your browser. It’s a straightforward, privacy-focused solution that ensures your HTML files are fully interactive and displayed as intended.

### Bonus Feature: View HTML Source Code
In addition to rendering your HTML files, iOS HTML Viewer offers an optional feature to view the source code of the uploaded file. This is particularly useful for developers who want to inspect, debug, or review the HTML content. You can easily toggle between the rendered view and the source code, all within the same tool.

## Key Features
- **Full HTML Rendering**: Supports external CSS and JavaScript, providing a desktop-like viewing experience on iOS.
- **View Source Code**: Optionally view the raw HTML source code of your uploaded file.
- **Privacy First**: Your uploaded HTML files are processed locally on your device, ensuring complete privacy and security.
- **Cross-Platform**: While designed for iOS, this viewer also works on other platforms like Android and desktop browsers.
- **Standalone Mode**: Can be added to your home screen as a standalone app, though browser use is recommended due to refresh limitations in standalone mode.
